# Surf_Shop_Analysis
Analyzing weather data for Hawaii via Jupyter Notebook and Python

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if a surf and shake shop could operate year round. To do this we needed to verify temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. The way to do this was to create one query for each of the months and then convert them into a dataframe. Afterwards we are able to use the .describe() method to get a summary of our statistics. 

## Results

### Differences
1. Between the two months June has a max temp of 85 degrees while December reaches 83
2. June has a min temp of 64 while December gets as low as 56
3. The mean is approx. 75 degrees in June while December has a mean of 71 degrees. 

## Summary
While the weather analysis is helpful in deciding if the shop will be attractive to surfers year round, it fails to tell us other key points that could be vital in the success of a business. These points are as follows, population of the island and tourist fluctuation by season, percipitation by month, and surfer totals per beach on Oahu. There are more details that we should be thoughtful of in this business decision but these simply list a few. To make an accurate analysis of if this shop will be profitable you will need more insights.
